Messagebox is delayed when copying URL
--------------------------------------
Repro steps
01 - start the app
02 - click "add new account"
03 - click "Copy URL"

Expected behaviour:
Cursor becomes the "busy" icon and then a messagebox is displayed telling the user that the operation has finished

Observed behaviour:
Cursor returns to "normal" for a few seconds before the messagebox is displayed.
The two lines of code are one after the other. Delay loading string library maybe?

Replying to a tweet reduces the number of characters available
---------------------------------------------------------------
Repro steps:
01 - Open Thread Creator form
02 - Select a tweet to reply to
03 - Ensure intro is blank
04 - Ensure numbering is OFF
05 - Enter 140 characters

Expected behaviour:
Only a single tweet is needed for the thread with the text. Twitter now allows
140 characters to be used in replies.

Observed behaviour:
The tweet splits early. Specifically, it only allows:
  140 - 2 - (length of screen name being replied to)

Additional information:
The twitter API mandates that the screenname be included in the reply.
If the screenname is the first text, it trims it and does not show it in the tweet.
However, it STILL counts the screen name towards the tweet length.
If the code sends the 140 characters plus the "@" identifier, Twitter returns an error.
This seems to be a bug in the Titter API.


Replying to a tweet with more than one person in the mentions only replies to the author of the selected tweet 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Repro steps:
01 - Open Thread Creator form
02 - Select a tweet to reply to
03 - enter text
04 - click "tweet thread"

Expected behaviour:
All the names in the tweet being replied to are included in the thread.

Observed behaviour:
Only the name of the author of the tweet being replied to is used.
No other users will see the thread.

Additional information:
This is a knock-on effect of the Twitter API defect which insists that names are included in the text
but still counts them against the length of the initial tweet. The problem is not very noticeable for
just one name; but multiple names would lead to very odd looking (short) tweets. It would be possible
to exceed the maximim tweet size just with screen names.

Therefore, this is not to be fixed until the API bug is fixed.

It is debatable if this functionality is desirable. It could cause notification spam.

In fact, it is debatable if allowing the threading functionality as a reply is advisable AT ALL.
It could conceivably lead to spamming and/or huge threads in reply.

When replying to another user's tweet, the other user is tagged only in the first tweet of the thread.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Repro steps:
01 - Open Thread Creator form
02 - Select a tweet from another user to reply to
03 - enter text for more than one tweet
04 - click "tweet thread"

Expected behaviour:
Every tweet in the thread tags the other user

Observed behaviour:
Other user is tagged only in the first tweet.

Additional information:
Almost certainly related to the known issue where a user has to be tagged and this consumes some of the 140 characters


Multiple Retweet windows can cause errors in all such windows
-------------------------------------------------------------

Repro steps:
01 - Open several RT windows
02 - Begin a RT operation in each window, with identical schedule settings
03 - Wait

Expected behaviour:
Each window RTs without error

Observed behaviour:
Eventually, the windows start to show failures.
Three in each window were observed.

Additional information:
Error text not recorded at the time of testing.
Only observed once.
Note that Data layer is a single instance. Re-entrancy issues?
